# Minecraft: Java Edition default resource and data pack
This is the default data pack and resources for Minecraft Java Edition. Feel free to use this as a template for data/resource packs or simply to work out how some things work. As of June 2025, this is from  `1.21.5.jar` from my .minecraft directory.

The format for data packs is documented [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack#Contents) and [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack#Contents) for resource packs.
